# ðŸŽ­ Sentiment Analysis on IMDb Reviews using a Feedforward Neural Network  

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
This project implements **sentiment analysis** on IMDb movie reviews using a **Feedforward Neural Network (FNN)**. The model is built with **TensorFlow** and **TensorFlow Datasets (TFDS)**, using the **IMDb dataset** to classify movie reviews as **positive or negative**. A **Streamlit-based web application** is developed to allow users to input their own reviews and get real-time sentiment predictions.
